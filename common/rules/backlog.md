# Backlog

**Anything found and not fixed goes in `docs/backlog.md`** — a bug noticed on the way past, a
missing test, a document that has drifted, a shortcut taken on purpose. Not the chat, not the
commit message, not a bare `TODO`: those are read once or never, and the finding goes with them.

**Record what is outside the task; do not fix it in passing.** A fix nobody asked for is an
unreviewed change inside an unrelated commit. If it blocks the task, it is part of the task.

One entry per finding, newest first:

    ## Cancelling a paid booking skips the refund
    - Where: `src/modules/booking/booking.service.ts`, `cancel()`
    - Found: 2026-09-29, while adding booking notes
    - Problem: status becomes `cancelled`; no refund row is written. Cancel any paid booking.
    - Impact: every paid cancellation needs a manual refund

**Write it for someone who was not there:** what is wrong, how to see it, what it costs. "Clean
up the thing from the review" is a note to yourself, and it expires with your memory.

**Fixing an entry deletes it, in the same commit as the fix.** The file lists what is wrong
today; git remembers the rest. A code comment may point at an entry, never stand in for one.

Read the backlog before planning a slice. An entry touching the same code is either taken into
the plan or left there knowingly — never rediscovered halfway through.
